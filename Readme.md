* EMBER 2018 dataset    
We use the 2018 EMBER dataset, known for its challenging classification tasks, focusing on a subset of 337,035 malicious Windows PE files labeled by the top 100
malware families, each with over 400 samples. Features include file size, PE and COFF header details, DLL characteristics, imported and exported functions, and properties
like size and entropy, all computed using the feature hashing trick.
* AZ-Class    
The AZ-Class dataset contains 285,582 samples from 100 Android malware families, each with at least 200 samples. We extracted Drebin features (Arp et al.2014) from the apps, covering eight categories like hardware access, permissions, API calls, and network addresses.

### Environment
---
* pytorch version 2.0.1
* conda version 4.7.12
* python version 3.8.13
* NVIDIA RTX A6000
* CUDA version 11.4


## Experiment
1. command lines are follows:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py

2. You can change the Hyper Parameters and options by command line:

You can see the changable options on MalCL_torch/arguments.py


if you want to set the sample selection to L1_B_Mean, the command line is

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --sample_select L2_B_Mean
